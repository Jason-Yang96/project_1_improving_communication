# Project_1_improving_communication
starting project to improve the commuication between instructor, students and parents
### 20230811_day1
#### What did I do?
1. Think about the problem, which means why I have to start this project
   - I have felt for a long time since 2015 inconvenience about the communication between instructor, students and parents
   - In the process of letting students know the assignments, notifying again and sending a report of the class done at the day
   - I don't have any plan to make this service public yet.
   - **Just to improve the communication between us**
2. Ask developers what I have to do for building the service
   - Umm, lots of things which mostly I don't understand.
     - But I think "We don't lack resource, but intention and action"
3. Ask myself
   - You know, this is not commercial thing, which means this will not be profitable
   - Do you wanna really do this?
     - I have had strong desire to improve my life buiding and creating somethinig
     - Why Not?
